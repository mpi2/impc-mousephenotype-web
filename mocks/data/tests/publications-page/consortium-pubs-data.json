      "abstractText": "Mice carrying patient-associated base changes are powerful tools to define the causality of single-nucleotide variants to disease states. Epitope tags enable immuno-based studies of genes for which no antibodies are available. These alleles enable detailed and precise developmental, mechanistic, and translational research. The first step in generating these alleles is to identify within the target sequence-the orthologous sequence for base changes or the N or C terminus for epitope tags-appropriate Cas9 protospacer sequences. Subsequent steps include design and acquisition of a single-stranded oligonucleotide repair template, synthesis of a single guide RNA (sgRNA), collection of zygotes, and microinjection or electroporation of zygotes with Cas9 mRNA or protein, sgRNA, and repair template followed by screening born mice for the presence of the desired sequence change. Quality control of mouse lines includes screening for random or multicopy insertions of the repair template and, depending on sgRNA sequence, off-target sequence variation introduced by Cas9. © 2025 The Author(s).

      "abstractText": "<h4>Purpose</h4>Corneal dysmorphologies (CDs) are typically classified as either regressive degenerative corneal dystrophies (CDtrs) or defective growth and differentiation-driven corneal dysplasias (CDyps). Both eye disorders have multifactorial etiologies. While previous work has elucidated many aspects of CDs, such as presenting symptoms, epidemiology, and pathophysiology, the genetic mechanisms remain incompletely understood. The purpose of this study was to analyze phenotype data from 8,707 knockout mouse lines to identify new genes associated with the development of CDs in humans.<h4>Methods</h4>8,707 knockout mouse lines phenotyped by the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium were queried for genes associated with statistically significant (P < 0.0001) abnormal cornea morphology to identify candidate CD genes. Corneal abnormalities were investigated by histopathology. A literature search was used to determine the proportion of candidate genes previously associated with CDs in mice and humans. Phenotypes of human orthologues of mouse candidate genes were compared with known human CD genes to identify protein-protein interactions and molecular pathways using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING), Protein Analysis Through Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.<h4>Results</h4>Analysis of data from 8,707 knockout mouse lines identified 213 candidate CD genes. Of these, 37 (17%) genes were previously known to be associated with CD, including 14 in the mouse, 16 in humans, and 7 in both. The remaining 176 (83%) genes have not been previously implicated in CD. We also searched publicly available RNAseq data and found that 131 of the total 213 (61.5%) were expressed in adult human corneal tissue. STRING analysis showed several interactions within and between candidate and established CD proteins. All cellular pathways of the established genes were found in the PANTHER analysis of the candidate genes. Several of the candidate genes were implicated in corneal disease, such as TGF-ß signaling. We also identified other possible underappreciated mechanisms relevant to the human cornea.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We identified 213 mouse genes that resulted in statistically significant abnormal corneal phenotypes in knockout mice, many of which have not previously been implicated in corneal pathology. Bioinformatic analyses implicated candidate genes in several signaling pathways which are potential therapeutic targets.",

The IMPC now uses the programmable RNA-guided nuclease Cas9 for its increased capacity and flexibility to efficiently generate null alleles in the C57BL/6N strain. In addition to being a valuable novel and accessible research resource, the production of 3313 knockout mouse lines using comparable protocols provides a rich dataset to analyze experimental and biological variables affecting in vivo gene engineering with Cas9. Mouse line production has two critical steps - generation of founders with the desired allele and germline transmission (GLT) of that allele from founders to offspring. A systematic evaluation of the variables impacting success rates identified gene essentiality as the primary factor influencing successful production of null alleles. Collectively, our findings provide best practice recommendations for using Cas9 to generate alleles in mouse essential genes, many of which are orthologs of genes linked to human disease.",

Supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the MMRRC consists of 4 regionally distributed and dedicated vivaria, offices, and specialized laboratory facilities and an Informatics Coordination and Service Center (ICSC). The overarching purpose of the MMRRC is to facilitate groundbreaking biomedical research by offering an extensive repertoire of mutant mice that are essential for advancing the understanding of human physiology and disease. The function of the MMRRC is to identify, acquire, evaluate, characterize, cryopreserve, and distribute mutant mouse strains to qualified biomedical investigators around the nation and the globe. Mouse strains accepted from the research community are held to the highest scientific standards to optimize reproducibility and enhance scientific rigor and transparency. All submitted strains are thoroughly reviewed, documented, and validated using extensive scientific quality control measures. In addition, the MMRRC conducts resource-related research on cryopreservation, mouse genetics, environmental conditions, and other topics that enhance operations of the MMRRC. Today, the MMRRC maintains an archive of mice, cryopreserved embryos and sperm, embryonic stem (ES) cell lines, and murine hybridomas for nearly 65,000 alleles. Since its inception, the MMRRC has fulfilled more than 20,000 orders from 13,651 scientists at 8441 institutions worldwide. The MMRRC also provides numerous services to assist researchers, including scientific consultation, technical assistance, genetic assays, microbiome analysis, analytical phenotyping, pathology, cryorecovery, husbandry, breeding and colony management, infectious disease surveillance, and disease modeling. The ICSC coordinates MMRRC operations, interacts with researchers, and manages the website (mmrrc.org) and online catalogue. Researchers benefit from an expansive list of well-defined mouse models of disease that meet the highest scientific standards while submitting investigators benefit by having their mouse strains cryopreserved, protected, and distributed in compliance with NIH policies.",

This new knowledge has informed the genetic basis of rare diseases, posited gene product influences on common diseases, influenced research on targeted therapies, revealed functional pleiotropy, essentiality, and sexual dimorphism, and many more insights into the role of genes in health and disease. Its scientific contributions have been many and widespread, however there remain thousands of \"dark\" genes yet to be illuminated.

      "abstractText": "The goal of systems biology is to gain a network level understanding of how gene interactions influence biological states, and ultimately inform upon human disease. Given the scale and scope of systems biology studies, resource constraints often limit researchers when validating genome-wide phenomena and potentially lead to an incomplete understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Further, prioritization strategies are often biased towards known entities (e.g. previously studied genes/proteins with commercially available reagents), and other technical issues that limit experimental breadth. Here, heterogeneous biological information is modeled as an association graph to which a high-performance minimum dominating set solver is applied to maximize coverage across the graph, and thus increase the breadth of experimentation. First, we tested our model on retrieval of existing gene functional annotations and demonstrated that minimum dominating set returns more diverse terms when compared to other computational methods. Next, we utilized our heterogenous network and minimum dominating set solver to assist in the process of identifying understudied genes to be interrogated by the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium. Using an unbiased algorithmic strategy, poorly studied genes are prioritized from the remaining thousands of genes yet to be characterized. This method is tunable and extensible with the potential to incorporate additional user-defined prioritizing information. The minimum dominating set approach can be applied to any biological network in order to identify a tractable subset of features to test experimentally or to assist in prioritizing candidate genes associated with human disease.",

Using data from the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC), approximately half of mouse mutants are able to mimic, at least partially, the human ortholog disease phenotypes as computed by the PhenoDigm algorithm. We found the number of phenotypic abnormalities in the mouse and the corresponding Mendelian disorder, the pleiotropy and severity of the disease, and the viability and zygosity status of the mouse knockout to be associated with the ability of mouse models to recapitulate the human disorder. An analysis of the IMPC impact on disease gene discovery through a publication-tracking system revealed that the resource has been implicated in at least 109 validated rare disease-gene associations over the last decade.",

Several repositories document phenotypic annotations for rare disorders; however, there is a lack of comprehensive reporting on lethal phenotypes.<h4>Methods</h4>We queried Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man for terms related to lethality and classified all Mendelian genes according to the earliest age of death recorded for the associated disorders, from prenatal death to no reports of premature death. We characterized the genes across these lethality categories, examined the evidence on viability from mouse models and explored how this information could be used for novel gene discovery.<h4>Results</h4>We developed the Lethal Phenotypes Portal to showcase this curated catalog of human essential genes. Differences in the mode of inheritance, physiological systems affected, and disease class were found for genes in different lethality categories, as well as discrepancies between the lethal phenotypes observed in mouse and human.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We anticipate that this resource will aid clinicians in the diagnosis of early lethal conditions and assist researchers in investigating the properties that make these genes essential for human development.",

However, using transgenic instead of exogenous Cas9 to produce gene-edited animals creates unique issues including ill-defined transgene integration sites, the potential for prolonged Cas9 expression in transgenic embryos, and increased genotyping burden. To overcome these issues, we generated mice harboring an oocyte-specific, Gdf9 promoter driven, Cas9 transgene (Gdf9-Cas9) targeted as a single copy into the Hprt1 locus. The X-linked Hprt1 locus was selected because it is a defined integration site that does not influence transgene expression, and breeding of transgenic males generates obligate transgenic females to serve as embryo donors. Using microinjections and electroporation to introduce sgRNAs into zygotes derived from transgenic dams, we demonstrate that Gdf9-Cas9 mediates genome editing as efficiently as exogenous Cas9 at several loci. We show that genome editing efficiency is independent of transgene inheritance, verifying that maternally derived Cas9 facilitates genome editing. We also show that paternal inheritance of Gdf9-Cas9 does not mediate genome editing, confirming that Gdf9-Cas9 is not expressed in embryos. Finally, we demonstrate that off-target mutagenesis is equally rare when using transgenic or exogenous Cas9. Together, these results show that the Gdf9-Cas9 transgene is a viable alternative to exogenous Cas9.",
